The candidates, most of them close to finishing their degrees, can choose their internships based on the company, area, duration and type. Although not everyone is lucky to win an internship, the students already had that ice breaker, the experience of a real work interview, which will most definitely contribute in their future work experiences. But because not everything has to be serious, the last part of dotworks focuses on conviviality and leisure, allowing participants and interviewers to get to know each other better.",
