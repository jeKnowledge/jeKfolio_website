Meanwhile, independently organized TEDx events help on sharing ideas in communities around the world. Inspired by tradition, but also by innovation, a group of students from different faculties at the University of Coimbra decided to create a TEDx event. jeKnowledge was invited to develop their website, for the third year in a row. In this website you can find all the information about the event, such as the organizing team, speakers, program and partners. And still receives the live broadcast of the event on the homepage." ,
